title: Java Virtual Machine


The Java Virtual Machine is a [Virtual Machine](vm.html) that allows you to run
programs independently of the [OS](os.html) and platform.

Usually programs for the JVM get written in [Java](java.html), but there are
many other languages that can be compiled to Java ByteCode.

It is similar to the [Common Language Runtime](clr.html) that is used in the
[.NET Framework](dotnet.html).
