title: Content management system


A [Content Management System (CMS)][CMS] usually is software that allows to
manage different kinds of documents for the use on a web site. Popular examples
are [WordPress], [Typo3] and [Drupal].

I’ve written my own CMS called [Bread] and currently I’m working on a new
PHP CMS called [chx].
