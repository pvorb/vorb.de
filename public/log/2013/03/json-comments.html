      <section>
        <p>Every markup or data exchange format that I am aware of, supports the definition of comments. There’s only one exception: <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a>.</p>
<p>I am dealing with JSON a lot these days. Recently, many developers prefer JSON over the more complex <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> that’s been around for a while now. And that’s why it’s common practice to implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>-APIs in JSON instead of XML. Another common use case for JSON documents is configuration of software systems of all kind. Regularly I feel a need to comment some lines of such JSON documents. Maybe it’s just to clarify my intention or to make some notes for later.</p>
<p>If you work with JSON a lot, you will once come to a point where it would be great if you could have comments on some properties, a specific value or the like. Since JSON is a subset from JavaScript, one could think it would allow comments like in this example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript">{
  <span class="st">&quot;key&quot;</span>: <span class="st">&quot;value&quot;</span> <span class="co">// comment</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>But it doesn’t. The <a href="http://json.org/">JSON website</a> doesn’t say much about this circumstance. The <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627.html">corresponding RFC</a> doesn’t either. Douglas Crockford, who is said to have discovered JSON, gives <a href="http://youtu.be/-C-JoyNuQJs?t=16m6s">the answer</a> in his talk “The JSON Saga”. He states that initially you were allowed to use <code>// comments after a double slash</code> as well as <code>/* block comments */</code> in JSON. Later he decided to remove support for comments because of three reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Dangerous practices</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“People were putting instructions to the parser in comments, which was a really bad thing, because that would totally break interoperability, because this whole level of metalanguage wouldn’t be common, which would be outside of the standard.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Unnecessary complexity</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[...] And for some of the ports to other languages about half of the complexity of doing the thing was just doing the comments [...]”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Alignment with <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t really think that these are valid reasons for removing something as quintessential as comments, but at least there are reasons for this decision.</p>
<p>There are two possible ways of working around the lack of comments (besides from being frustrated and leaving them out).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You can either agree on a special property that holds a comment for the surrounding object. For example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode json"><code class="sourceCode json">{
  <span class="dt">&quot;key&quot;</span>: <span class="st">&quot;value&quot;</span>,
  <span class="dt">&quot;__comment&quot;</span>: <span class="st">&quot;defines a key and a value&quot;</span>
}</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Or you could use another markup format that supports comments. Examples would be XML, YAML or the newer <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md">HOCON (Human-Optimized Config Object Notation)</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Personally, I think that YAML is a bloated spec and HOCON is preferably used to configure software systems. Sometimes, bringing XML to client-side web applications can be a real pain, so in-JSON comments often are the only solution.</p>
