[Previously](tesseract-cygwin.html) I wrote about how to compile Tesseract OCR
using Cygwin. While this is nice if you want to compile Tesseract for your own
system where you can install Cygwin on your own, compiling with Visual Studio is
better if you intend to distribute the compiled package so users don't have to
install Cygwin.

Compiling Tesseract 3.02.02 with Visual C++ 2008 (Express) is [covered by the
documentation](http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/vs2008/doc/setup.html)
whereas compiling Tesseract 3.03 isn't covered at all, though.

Unfortunately newer versions of Tesseract also require a new version of
[Leptonica](http://www.leptonica.org/), a C library for image processing and
image analysis applications, which in turn requires new versions of zlib,
libpng, libtiff, libjpeg and giflib. Tesseract provides pre-compiled versions of
Leptonica, which prevents you from having to collect and set up projects for all
of these libraries in Visual Studio, which can be a tedious task.

Yesterday I found a project on GitHub that includes a Visual Studio solution
file for all dependencies required to compile Tesseract 3.03:
[charlesw/tesseract-vs2012](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract-vs2012). While
following the build instructions there, I stumpled over several build errors,
which I could easily resolve by removing a definition. The necessary change is
in [my fork](https://github.com/pvorb/tesseract-vs2013) of the repository
mentioned above.

This is a write-up of all steps that are required to compile Tesseract 3.03 with
Visual Studio 2013.

## Prerequisites

 1. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/).
 2. Install SVN. There are many versions of SVN. You can, for example, install
    the binary package from [SlickSVN](http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download) for
    free.
 3. Install [Visual Studio 2013 for Windows Desktop](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs)
    (the Express version will be enough). You don't need the optional features
    except for "Microsoft Foundation Classes for C++".

## Building the dependencies

 1. Create a directory where you want to compile Tesseract. In this document,
    I'll assume it's `C:\Tesseract-Build\`.
 2. Open a CMD prompt and change to that directory.

    ~~~
    cd \Tesseract-Build\
    ~~~
 3. Clone the dependencies repository from GitHub.

    ~~~
    git clone git://github.com/pvorb/tesseract-vs2013.git
    ~~~
 4. Open the "VS 2013 Developer Command Prompt". (It can be found in the Start
    Menu.)
 5. Change to the newly cloned repository.

    ~~~
    cd \Tesseract-Build\tesseract-vs2013
    ~~~
 6. Build the dependencies

    ~~~
    msbuild build.proj
    ~~~
 7. You can close the "VS 2013 Developer Command Prompt".

## Building Tesseract

 1. Re-open the first command prompt and ensure it's still in
    `C:\Tesseract-Build\`.
 2. Get the latest source from SVN.

    ~~~
    svn checkout http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tesseract-ocr
    ~~~
 3. Change to the newly checked-out repository.

    ~~~
    cd tesseract-ocr
    ~~~
 4. Apply the patch provided in `tesseract-vs2013`.

    ~~~
    svn patch ..\tesseract-vs2013\vs2013+64bit_support.patch
    ~~~
 5. Copy both directories in `C:\Tesseract-Build\tesseract-vs2013\release\` to
    `C:\Tesseract-Build\`. Now you should have

      - `C:\Tesseract-Build\include\`
      - `C:\Tesseract-Build\lib\`
 6. Open `C:\Tesseract-Build\tesseract-ocr\vs2013\tesseract.sln` with Visual
    Studio 2013.
 7. Press `F7` on your keyboard. Both `libtesseract303` and `tesseract` should
    compile without errors.

The Visual Studio solution file contains configurations for dynamic and static
compilation as well as debugging and release configurations for both 32-Bit and
64-Bit. Select whichever configuration you need and recompile with `F7`.

You can find the compiled binaries in
`C:\Tesseract-Build\tesseract-ocr\vs2013\bin\`.
